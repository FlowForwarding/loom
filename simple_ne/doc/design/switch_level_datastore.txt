The switch level datastore is an authoritative store of all configuration of an OpenFlow switch. It is used by the ofs_handler

Requirements
-----------

1, store flows, groups, meters, et.c.
2, support the OpenFlow semantics for modifying and deleting flows with normal or strict matching
3, support the OpenFlow semantic for deleting flows when deleting groups or meters
4, support multiple OpenFlow versions
5, provide lookup with with filters using OpenFlow normal or strict matching semantics
6, provide test functions to check how many, or which, flows will be affected by an operation on the switch
7, maintain two versions of the data,
   1) the currently confirmed state, this is the authorative view of the switch
   2) the planned state, this is the future state when all requests issued to the switch has been successfully executed
8, provide multigenerational locking, i.e. when checking if it is possible to submit a request to the switch check if the requests overlaps with any issued requests both in the confirmed state and the planned state
9, provide a commit function, this moves the changes planned by a request from the planned state to the confirmed state, and removes the lock on the flows
10, provide rollback function, remove the changes from the planned state and remove the lock from the confirmed state
11, the design shall separate as much as possible the logic from the actual data storage to make it possible to change the storage backend
12, the initial storage backend will be ets
