OpenFlow Message library is a high level library for generating OpenFlow messages without having to know the data structures used by linc.

Requirements

The API shall
1, the function names shall reflect the logical operation to perform, and not the exact OpenFlow message used.
2, accept logical names, atoms, instead of numeric values where appropriate, e.g.  ipv4 and ipv6 instead of 0x0800 or 0x86dd.
3, automatically insert prerequisite match fields when they can be unambigously determined.
4, provide message validation.
5, transform received OpenFlow messages to a format similar to that used in the requests.
6, support multiple OpenFlow versions

The most complex data structure used in OpenFlow is the matches used in flow definitions and as filters in several other operations.
The proposed format for this is
Matches = [Match]
Match = {FieldName, Value} | {FieldName, Value, Mask}

A large part of this already exists in various modules in of_protocol, link and the Infoblox Loom codebase.
- Consolidate message existing message generation code from various existing modules
- Parameterize some generators that currently only hardcode parameters
- Add "parser" that converts linc, (or rather of_protocol), data structures to the message library format.
- Add validation, especially of matches and operations in flow definitions.
