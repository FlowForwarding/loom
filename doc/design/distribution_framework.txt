Due to the scale of loom, every logical function has to be able to be distributed over several nodes.

Requirements

1, keep several pools of nodes for different functions, e.g.OpenFlow drivers or flow planning
2, when a new process shall be started, decide based on some criteria, e.g. current load or proximity to some resource, which node to start the process on
3, provide a routing function to route messages to the node currently handling the required service, e.g. OpenFlow driver for a specific OpenFlow switch
4, supervise all nodes
5, if a node fails, restart all processes that were running on the failed node on other nodes
