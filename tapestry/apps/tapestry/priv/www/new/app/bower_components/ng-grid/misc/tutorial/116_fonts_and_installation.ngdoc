@name Tutorial: 116 Fonts and Installation
@description

We get a lot of questions about fonts, and it seems to be a pain point for many users.  To date all
of these problems have been diagnosed to a misconfigured build setup for the end user.

This tutorial addresses the basics of the configuration.

Key points here are:

1. Fonts are a derivative of font-awesome via fontello, and are used for the dropdown icons and 
various menu buttons and the like.  When they're not working they show a "chinese looking" character.  
2. The tutorial pages generally show the fonts correctly.  If a tutorial page, when served from
ui-grid.info is not showing fonts correctly, then this is likely a defect with ui-grid.  If it's 
working on ui-grid.info, but not in your application, then it's likely a defect in your build configuration
3. The fonts __never__ work on plunkrs.  This isn't a defect, it's a configuration issue where the
plunkr blocks "cross-domain" resource requests - it won't serve fonts from ui-grid.info when
the plunkr itself is on `plunkr.co`.  The fact that plunkrs don't show fonts doesn't make this 
an issue with ui-grid, it's still likely an issue with your configuration.  :-)

When you download and install ui-grid, you'll get a series of files:

- `ui-grid.js`
- `ui-grid.css`
- `ui-grid.eot`
- `ui-grid.svg`
- `ui-grid.ttf`
- `ui-grid.woff`

The last four files are the font files.  These generally need to be inserted into your local build process,
as they will need to be copied to your `assets` folder, your `fonts` folder or some other similar location. 
The instructions for configuring this are different for each build setup, but your build environment should
have come with some method for configuring this - usually a Gruntfile.js, a build.config.js, or some form of
gulp configuration.

If you are seeking to diagnose why you're not getting your fonts, you can typically look at your Chrome developer
tools, and you'll see a network request being issued for one of the font files, which then gives an error not
found.  As a first step, try manually copying the font files into that location.  If your application now works,
then your goal is to work out how to configure your build process to do that automatically for you.
