@name Tutorial: 200 Features
@description

The core module, ui.grid, contains only the core features needed.  More complex features are separated into feature modules and must be included in your application module.

You must include each feature as a dependency for your application module.
<pre>
angular.module('yourApp', ['ui.grid', 'ui.grid.feature1', 'ui.grid.feature2']);
</pre>

Each feature directive must also be included in alongside the ui-grid directive.  This allows you to have many grids in an application and enable certain features for each grid instance.
<pre>
<div ui-grid="gridOptions" class="grid" ui-grid-feature1 ui-grid-feature2></div>
</pre>
